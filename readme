# Bidwhist

## Game Rules
The game is called bidwhist; A trick taking game.

It consists of 4 players, 2 per team, and the teams are across from eachother.

The game starts off dealing 12 cards to each of the 4 players, and alloting 6 to the "Kitty", totaling 54 cards in total.

Each person bids 4 through 7, or they can pass.

Highest bid takes the kitty and adds it to their hand, and then they discard 6 that they don't want.

They then call "Trump", or the Suit that beats all others, and play the first card.

Whoever plays the highest card of the suit that was led wins the trick, unless a trump card is played, in which case the highest trump card wins.

The leading player is the one who won the last trick.

A player must follow suit of the leading card. If a player does not have a card of the suit that was led, they may play any card.

The winner of the trick leads the next trick. The game ends when all cards have been played, or the team that didn't take the kitty takes (8 - bid) tricks
